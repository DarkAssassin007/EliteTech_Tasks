Project: Deep Learning Model for Image Classification (CIFAR-10)

Description:
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels) across 10 classes such as airplanes, cars, cats, and ships.

Key Steps:
1. Load and normalize the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Build a CNN model with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
3. Compile and train the model using Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy.
4. Visualize training and validation accuracy over 20 epochs.
5. Show predictions on random test images with predicted and actual labels.

Tools Used:
- TensorFlow (for deep learning model)
- Matplotlib (for result visualization)
- NumPy (for random sampling and data manipulation)

How to Run:
Ensure TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib are installed, then run the script.

Output:
- Training and validation accuracy plot.
- Sample prediction results on test images.

This project demonstrates the basic workflow of training and evaluating a deep learning image classifier.
